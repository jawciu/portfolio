# CLAUDE.md — Portfolio

Personal portfolio site for **Caroline Jaworsky** (product designer, AI builder). Moody graphic-designer
vibe: dark background, light/holographic diffused imagery. Built for a job hunt.

> This file is the shared brain for every agent session. Keep it current: log progress and important
> decisions as they happen, and leave handoff notes at the end of each session (see **Session Log** at the
> bottom). The behaviour is defined by the global `session-journal` skill.

## Design tokens (`app/globals.css` `@theme`)

- Background: `--color-bg #050507`, `--color-bg-elev #0a0a0d`
- Foreground: `--color-fg #f5f5f5`, `--color-fg-muted #8a8a92`
- Accents: `--color-accent-cyan #00d4ff`, `--color-accent-magenta #ff006e`, `--color-accent-amber #ffaa00`
- Fonts (CSS vars): `--font-hero` (Iosevka Charon, headline), `--font-display` (Bricolage Grotesque),
  `--font-body` (Geist), `--font-mono` (Geist Mono)
- Use the Tailwind utility names (`bg-bg`, `text-fg`, `text-fg-muted`, `font-hero`, …), not raw hex.

## Project skills (`.claude/skills/`)

Read the matching skill BEFORE working in its area:

- **orb-firewall-tuning** — tune the orb + firewall visuals; the screenshot iteration loop
- **glsl-shader-effects** — authoring GLSL for the holographic/glitch aesthetic
- **r3f-hero-scene** — R3F scene scaffolding, SSR/dynamic loading, postprocessing, mobile fallbacks
- **scroll-choreography** — GSAP ScrollTrigger, Lenis, Motion transitions, scroll-driven uniforms
- **portfolio-architecture** — routes, MDX case studies, SEO/OG, asset organization, structure

## Conventions

- Dark theme only; reference the moodboard direction (holographic / glitchy / circuit-board, moody dark).
- Hero visuals are iterated via the **screenshot loop** against `public/assets/distorted-orb.png`, reviewed
  through "3d bro" + "creative director" personas (see `orb-firewall-tuning` skill).
- Branch per workstream (current: `firewall-prev`). Commit/push only when Caroline asks.

## Decision Log

Newest first. Record *why*, not just *what*.

- **2026-06-10** — **Scroll-driven liquid-glass motion on the About portrait** (Caroline:
  "shine that moves when you scroll"; researched Apple Liquid Glass first — its signature
  is specular highlights that MOVE with device motion, so scroll stands in for tilt).
  V1 was a straight diagonal streak sweeping the photo — Caroline redirected with a glass
  sphere reference: reflections must be **curved arcs hugging the rim, light AND dark,
  following the circle**. Final build (`ARCS` const in `About.tsx`): three annular bands —
  each a `closest-side` radial ring gradient cut to an arc by a conic-gradient mask,
  `blur(3px)` — (1) broad crown highlight across the top (0.13 white, wide), (2) crisp
  bright arc lower-right (0.30 white, thin, hugging 84–96% radius), (3) shadow arc
  lower-left (0.50 black). They're SIBLINGS of the masked disc (the dissolve would dim
  rim-radius content to ~0.2–0.3 alpha — same reason the glass ring lives outside), and
  scroll ROTATES each at a different rate/direction via scrubbed ScrollTriggers
  (`useGSAP`, scope = section ref, `scrub: 0.6`) — reflections slide around the rim like
  the sphere is turning. Reduced-motion-safe via `gsap.matchMedia`. Rim glint stays
  light-right/shadow-left (`from 180deg`). **Round 2 (Apple Podcasts Liquid Glass icon
  ref + Icon Composer research — "crisp specular highlights preserve contrast at the
  edges", lit from above):** dropped the lower-left shadow arc (too much), shrank the
  crown (~44° core span), and gave both remaining arcs ASYMMETRIC edges — long soft ramp
  from the inside (light dispersing into glass) to a peak, then a hard cut at the outer
  radius (the crisp specular line). No blur filter on arcs — softness lives in the
  gradient stops; a blur would kill the crisp outer line. **Motion-visibility fix**
  (Caroline couldn't see it; transforms verified changing — the rotation was just spread
  over the section's whole viewport transit, so little played while the disc was
  on-screen): ranges widened to crown -75→75, lower-right 95→-50, ring -60→60 (commit
  `eccbf3c`). If still too subtle/strong, these ranges are the dial. Polish round: outer
  edges of both arcs softened a touch (fade ~doubled — still the "sharp" edge, just not
  knife-cut), and ONE glint hotspot added — a small bright oval nested INSIDE the
  lower-right arc layer (so it orbits with it on scroll, no extra animation), offset
  right of the arc's centre (~105° around the rim). Caroline explicitly wanted a single
  glint, bottom arc only, off-centre — tried top + both first.
- **2026-06-09** — **Real portrait in About** (`public/assets/portrait.png`, from
  `~/Downloads/portfolio ideas/me.png`): a circular cut-out PNG with transparent corners,
  so the old rounded-square card + border was dropped. Caroline then asked to drop the
  radial pool behind it too (read as a "square placeholder"), and to make the photo itself
  **look glass**: it now sits under a circular glass lens — diagonal sheen
  (`mix-blend-screen`), glare arc near the top-left rim, hairline ring + top glint, and an
  inset bottom shadow so the disc reads curved. Same specular language as the About sheet.
  Plus a **blur vignette**: a second blurred copy of the image (`blur(20px)`) masked to the
  rim with a radial `maskImage` (transparent ≤32%, opaque ≥76% — Caroline asked for the
  melt spread further inward), and a **dark vignette** on top (radial, transparent 52% →
  rgba(5,5,7,0.55) at the rim) to seat the disc into the dark page. Then "clear ring"
  feedback → removed the hairline ring/glint layer entirely and masked the WHOLE disc with
  a 4-stop radial alpha fade (black 42% → 0.62 @64% → 0.22 @82% → transparent 95%), so the
  photo dissolves into the page with no clipped edge — orb-style. Final pass (after commit
  `95467ce`): **true orb edges** — photo inset with `p-7` inside its box and the
  `overflow-hidden rounded-full` clip removed (the PNG's own transparency is the circle),
  so the rim copy's blur SMEARS content outward past the photo edge into the margin before
  the outer mask dissolves it; disc nudged left (`md:-ml-10`). Caroline's final calibration
  after a too-blurry detour: photo stays sharp, blur is rim-only — `blur(24px)` masked
  `transparent 60% → black 88%` (closest-side). Lesson: she wants "no sharp edge", not
  "dreamy soft-focus" — keep the subject crisp. Then a **glass edge** on top: a crisp ~2px
  glassmorphism ring (conic gradient so it reads lit — 0.60 white peak top-left, ~0.1–0.2
  around) rendered as a SIBLING of the masked disc at `inset-7 rounded-full` — outside the
  dissolve mask so the fade can't eat it. First attempt was a 7px feathered band → "why so
  thick?"; she wanted a thin crisp glass-design border, no blur. Final: hairline ~1px
  (annulus stops 99.0→99.3→99.8→100%) with strong glint contrast — 0.90 white peak
  top-left vs 0.02–0.10 base around the rest. Key insight: alpha fade alone reads as a
  soft ring; orbs need the content itself bleeding outward, which requires unclipped room
  around the image. Second key gotcha: radial gradients/masks default to **farthest-corner**
  sizing, so square overlay layers (sheen/glare/vignette) kept partial opacity into the
  box corners and ghosted a *square* around the disc — fixed by sizing the container mask
  and vignette with `circle closest-side` (nothing can render outside the inscribed
  circle).
- **2026-06-09** — **Fixed the long-standing `disableNormalPass` error** in
  `hero/Effects.tsx`: `@react-three/postprocessing` v3 removed the NormalPass entirely, so
  the prop no longer exists — deleted it (no behaviour change; the normal pass never ran).
  `tsc --noEmit` is now fully clean. The scary runtime crash Caroline saw alongside it
  (`EffectComposer.addPass → null.alpha`) was a transient dev/HMR lost-WebGL-context
  artifact — gone on fresh load, 0 console errors.
- **2026-06-09** — **Glass shine pass** (Caroline: glass felt matte). Replaced the flat 1px
  `border-t` + inset shadow with a three-layer specular story in `About.tsx`: (1) gradient
  rim hairline that peaks bright (0.55 white) at ~18% from the left — a glint, not a line;
  (2) a soft light pool bleeding ~11rem down from under the glint (radial, 0.10 white);
  (3) a 115° diagonal sheen sweep across the whole sheet (`mix-blend-screen`, 0.085 → 0
  → 0.04) — the Apple-glass move. All `aria-hidden` overlay divs clipped by the section's
  rounded corners.
- **2026-06-09** — **About is now a glass sheet** (Caroline: the solid black plate after the
  hero was "too harsh" — wants Apple-glass so the orbs show through). Dropped `bg-bg` from
  the below-hero plate wrapper in `page.tsx`; `About.tsx` got the glass: `backdrop-blur-2xl
  backdrop-saturate-150`, translucent gradient `rgba(5,5,7,0.38) → 0.66 → #050507` (lands
  on solid bg so the opaque sections below join with no seam — they sit in their own
  `bg-bg` wrapper), `rounded-t-[2.5rem]` + `border-t border-fg/15` + inset top highlight
  for the sheet look. The fixed hero canvas (z-0) frosts through; verified bio text stays
  legible over the brightest orb glow. Sections after About (marquee/work/toolkit) remain
  fully opaque on purpose.
- **2026-06-09** — **bento2 reworked to true hero language** (round 3, per Caroline: "each
  folder has very soft diffused edges, no hard lines — like the orbs/fireball edges — and
  only hero fonts + hero colours"). Killed every box: no borders, no panel rects, no
  scrims, no box-shadows. Each folder is now radial colour pools that die to transparent
  *inside* the cell (gaussian-ish stops at ~65–68%), so the panel's rectangular extent is
  never readable — collapsed folders are narrow floating wisps (reads like the fireball
  chain), the open one blooms into 2–3 offset blobs. Type: `font-hero` (Iosevka) for
  company/title/description — title styled like the hero H1, company like the "Hi I'm
  Caroline," intro line, meta rows like the hero role line (square + bullet, mono).
  Palettes lifted verbatim from the hero shaders: fireball flameRamp (#FF8858 #F56267
  #E560FA #793CEA #2835A8) + DistortedOrb consts (#ff2f7e #ff8526 #ffcf52 #3fc4ad
  #bdeed9). Key learning: first pass had pools sized ~55–110% of the cell which read as
  hazy rectangles/bars — shrinking to ~30–48% with dark breathing room is what makes the
  blob-in-dark orb feel.
- **2026-06-09** — Round-2 showcase remixes from Caroline's feedback (she loves bento +
  shell; committed round 1 as `627699e` and pushed): **bento2** "Diffused grain mosaic" —
  bento read too *sharp* against the diffuse hero, so hard linear gradients became soft
  radial colour pools dying into dark, plus film grain, hairline borders, glow (not
  scanlines) on the open panel. **shell2** "Soft shell + pixel sprites" — the CLI had tag
  soup and could confuse non-terminal visitors, so: airy rows, human names (no
  `drwxr-xr-x`), ONE quiet meta line, and her idea of a per-project "image" à la Claude
  Code's boot logo → a deterministic slug-seeded **pixel sprite** (mirrored like a space
  invader, sharp grid + blurred glow copy = pixel-y AND diffused). Shared helpers in
  `prototype/softBits.tsx` (Grain overlay, PixelSprite; sprites are deterministic so
  SSR/client match). Both verified rendering, 0 console errors.
- **2026-06-09** — On branch `project-showcase-experiment`, prototyped **3 alternative
  ways to showcase the projects** (Caroline wanted something edgier/funner but still
  dead-simple). UI prototype, sub-shape A: variants render on the existing `#work` route
  via `?variant=`, flipped by a floating dev-only switcher bar (← / → keys). Kept the
  current carousel as `?variant=current` baseline. Variants (all on-brand, structurally
  distinct): **shell** (`~/work` terminal directory listing, ↑↓/↵/esc — a designer's work
  as a CLI, plays off the existing path-label + telemetry HUD), **deck** (holographic
  draggable card stack, drag/flick to throw the top card), **bento** (reflowing spotlight
  mosaic — all projects visible, hover expands one with a glitch-scan). Lives in
  `components/sections/prototype/` (throwaway; `NOTES.md` there has the verdict template +
  cleanup steps). Extra per-project metadata (year/role/stack/status) in
  `prototype/projectMeta.ts` so variants aren't empty — fold survivors into
  `lib/projects.ts` when one wins. Verified all 4 render, 0 console errors. **Awaiting
  Caroline's pick** before folding the winner in and deleting the rest.
- **2026-06-09** — Scaffolded the four below-the-hero sections from the Figma comp
  (`figma.com/design/1crZakXfGsPCpxdXIrcjHo`, node 2-2): **About** (placeholder portrait left + fast
  streaming bio right, triggered by `useInView`), **ProjectsMarquee** (filled + outline "PROJECTS" strips),
  **ProjectCarousel** (center-focus, hover-zones step one project at a time, click/dots/arrow-key nav), and
  **Toolkit** (icon-tile marquee). Built a reusable `Marquee` primitive for both loops. Decisions:
  (a) both marquee rows scroll right-to-left per Caroline's spec — flip via `reverse` prop (opposite
  directions is the common alt). (b) Only the Nest card is real (`lib/projects.ts` index 0); the rest are
  `placeholder: true` → "Project NN". Imagery + portrait + real toolkit icons are gradient/text placeholders
  awaiting assets (clear swap-points commented in each file). (c) Post-hero sections live on a
  `relative z-10 bg-bg` plate so the fixed WebGL canvas (Hero, z-0) doesn't bleed through.
- **2026-06-09** — Installed the official **Playwright MCP** server (`@playwright/mcp`) at user scope for
  later interactive usability/a11y audits. Needs a Claude Code restart to surface the browser tools.
- **2026-06-09** — Established this `CLAUDE.md` as the persistent project brain + adopted the
  `session-journal` workflow (ongoing logging + end-of-session handoffs). Reason: Caroline wants new agent
  sessions to pick up seamlessly without her re-explaining context.
- **2026-06-09** — Replaced the right-edge vertical label (`Portfolio // 2026 // Selected_Works`) with a
  **telemetry strip** (`components/TelemetryRail.tsx`): `WEBGL2 · TIER n · DPR n · n FPS` (font `text-fg/70`,
  matched to the top-left `~/caro/portfolio/2026` path label).
  Every token is a real fact about the visitor's session — WebGL context, their detect-gpu `useGPUTier`,
  effective DPR (mirrors Scene's `[1,2]`/`[1,1.5]` clamp), and **raw live FPS** (Caroline chose raw over
  capped — she wants the number visibly changing). FPS is counted per ~⅓s window and written straight to the
  DOM via a ref (NO setState 60×/sec — same rule as the parallax). Reduced motion → render loop is on-demand,
  so it swaps to `STATIC`. WebGL/DPR use `useSyncExternalStore` (SSR-safe, no setState-in-effect, matches
  `usePrefersReducedMotion`). Reason: the old label was dead wayfinding (header nav already orients); the HUD
  is on-brand and audience-layered — casual visitors see cool mono chrome, technical ones clock it's live.
- **2026-06-09** — Fireball **nose + parallax separation + orb smoothing**: (a) nose (disc0) forced fully
  shown (`vis = 1` for i==0) so it's the only un-cut shape; its blue leading-edge **rim is kept** (Caroline
  wanted it) — on a guaranteed full circle it reads as a rim around a ball, not a left "cut". (b)
  **Separated** the fireball hover-reveal from the orb parallax: gated `hoverReveal` by a vertical `zone =
  1 - smoothstep(0.58, 0.82, 1.0 - uMouse.y)` so it only reacts in the UPPER screen (fireball) and holds
  baseline when the cursor is over the orb row (lower screen). (c) **Smoothed the orb cursor** in
  `DistortedOrb.tsx` — a shared `smoothMouse` ref lerped `0.25`/frame, passed to the orbs instead of the raw
  ref (which jumped between irregular `pointermove` events = stutter/glitch). Kept snappy so it doesn't feel
  laggy; independent of the fireball's own `uMouse` smoothing, so the two parallaxes stay fully separate.
- **2026-06-09** — Firewall **head unified into caps** (fixes the disc1↔disc2 blend lens + layering):
  reworked the head pass so ALL discs (0,1,2) use the same flat-LEFT reveal cut and are drawn FRONT-to-BACK
  (`i = p`: nose = bottom, disc2 = top) — each cap sits over the previous, which pokes out on the left, just
  like the chain. Removed disc0/disc1's old flat-RIGHT cut (the two facing flat edges were what stacked
  additive glow into a magenta blend lens between the 2nd & 3rd circles). disc0 (t=0) stays a full round
  nose; disc1 is now a flat-left cap that opens on hover; tightened `sf` for i==1 `0.72→0.44` so the nose
  tucks under disc1. Reason: Caroline wanted the 2nd↔3rd overlap to read like the clean 3rd↔4th ("one under
  the other"), disc1 to get the hover-reveal, and the nose layered beneath disc1 with a straight left edge.
- **2026-06-09** — Fireball **hover-reveal** (mirrors the orbs): wired `uMouse` into the firewall reveal
  `cut` in `backdropFragment` so the cursor moving toward the fireball (screen LEFT) unmasks more of each
  circle — `hoverReveal = max(0.5 - uMouse.x, 0.0) * 0.40`, subtracted from the cut coefficient (disc2 +
  chain 3–6 left cut; disc1's right cut slides out; disc0 nose stays full). One-sided so it only ever
  exposes MORE than baseline (discs grow into each other, never gap). Bumped `Backdrop.tsx` mouse lerp
  `0.05→0.12` so the reveal tracks the cursor responsively. Reason: Caroline clarified the orbs' "parallax"
  is really a mouse-driven unmask, and wanted the same hover-to-reveal on the fireball (NOT positional
  drift — the earlier `par` magnitude bump was reverted to the original `0.03`).
- **Firewall tuning** (commits through `da30e07`) — rebuilt the firewall backdrop as masked discs matching
  the reference; iterated head spacing, per-shape sizing, full-circle nose, removed chain crease lines so
  caps blend at overlaps. See `git log` + `orb-firewall-tuning` skill.
- **Tech stack** (2026-05-26) — Next.js + R3F + GSAP + Motion + Lenis. See `research/`.

## Session Log / Handoff

> Latest handoff lives at the top. At the end of a session, append a new entry with: what changed, current
> state (working / broken / in-progress), and explicit next steps for the next agent. Capture stated intent
> ("tomorrow we do X") and long absences here too.

### 2026-06-09 — CLAUDE.md bootstrap
- **Done:** Created this file; documented stack, architecture, tokens, skills, commands. Set up the
  `session-journal` global skill + global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so every project session maintains its own
  CLAUDE.md automatically.
- **State:** On branch `firewall-prev`. Below-hero sections now scaffolded (About / ProjectsMarquee /
  ProjectCarousel / Toolkit) and rendering — lint/typecheck clean for the new files (a pre-existing
  `setState`-in-effect lint warning in `HeroCopy.tsx` and a `disableNormalPass` type error in
  `hero/Effects.tsx` are untouched/unrelated). Nothing committed yet.
- **Next (design iteration):** drop in the real assets — portrait (`About.tsx`), per-project imagery +
  remaining real project cards (`lib/projects.ts`), program icons (`Toolkit.tsx`); tune carousel `SPREAD`
  /`SIDE_SCALE` and marquee speeds/directions. Then case-study routes under `#work`.
- **Open intent:** none recorded yet.
